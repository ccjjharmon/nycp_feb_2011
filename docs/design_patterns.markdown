#Design Patterns

1. Specification Pattern
Determine if an object meets a certain condition.
 examples : Validation, Filtering, Collision Detection, Drag Drop

2. Composite Pattern
Treat sets of related items as one unit by going through a common contract that is implemented by both the root and leaf items.

3. Decorator Pattern
Add behaviour to an existing component (prefer composition)
