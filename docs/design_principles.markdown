#Design Principles

1. Single Responsibility Principle

A class should have one reason and one reason only to change.
(Cohesion).

2. Open Closed Principle

A class should be open for extension closed for modification.

3. DRY Principle
Don't repeat yourself

4. Encapsulate What Varies
Separate that which changes from that which does not

5. Code to contracts not implementations

6. Favour composition over inheritance
